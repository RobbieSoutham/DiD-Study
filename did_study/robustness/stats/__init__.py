"""
Statistical diagnostics for DiD robustness.

This subpackage contains routines for computing statistical quantities
used in robustness checks.  Currently the main modules are:

* :mod:`did_study.robustness.stats.pretrend` - joint and linear
  pre-trend tests for event study coefficients.
* :mod:`did_study.robustness.stats.mde` - minimum detectable effect
  calculations.

Additional statistical routines can be added here in the future as
needed.
